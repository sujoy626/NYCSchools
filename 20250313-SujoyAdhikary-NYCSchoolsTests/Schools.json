The urban planning theme-based curriculum takes students out of the classroom and into their communities to develop skills that will move them toward higher education and careers, while at the same time tapping into their innate curiosity towards the world around them.","school_10th_seats":"1","academicopportunities1":"College NOW courses at Medgar Evers College","academicopportunities2":"College Summit","academicopportunities3":"National Academy Foundation: Green Technology, Coding, and Architecture courses","academicopportunities4":"All students are expected to complete their NY State Regents Exam requirements by the end of their sophomore year","ell_programs":"English as a New Language","language_classes":"Spanish","advancedplacement_courses":"AP Biology, AP Calculus, AP Economics, AP English, AP Spanish, AP US History","neighborhood":"Bushwick","shared_space":"Yes","campus_name":"Bushwick Educational Campus","building_code":"K480","location":"400 Irving Avenue, Brooklyn NY 11237 (40.696457, -73.911751)","phone_number":"718-381-7100","fax_number":"718-418-0314","school_email":"knorman3@schools.nyc.gov","website":"www.aupnyc.org","subway":"L, M to Myrtle Ave-Wyckoff Ave","bus":"B13, B20, B26, B38, B52, B54, B60, Q55, Q58","grades2018":"9-12","finalgrades":"9-12","total_students":"227","start_time":"8:15am","end_time":"3:45pm","addtl_info1":"Community School","extracurricular_activities":"Advanced Art, African Dance, African Drumming, Annual Â“Day of DialogueÂ” Student-led Conference, Cheerleading, Community Service, Fine Arts, Hispanic Cultural Club, National Honor Society, Peer Mediation, Peer Tutoring, Student Government, Student Leadership Council, Student Newspaper, Video Game Club","psal_sports_boys":"Baseball, Basketball, Soccer, Volleyball","psal_sports_girls":"Basketball, Softball, Volleyball","school_sports":"Baseball, Basketball, Flag Football, Volleyball, Weightlifting","graduation_rate":"0.55400002","attendance_rate":"0.819999993","pct_stu_enough_variety":"0.720000029","college_career_rate":"0.307000011","pct_stu_safe":"0.790000021","school_accessibility_description":"1","prgdesc1":"Students take urban studies theme-based electives and participate in urban planning projects in regular subject area classes that incorporate art, technology, community development, and civic engagement.","offer_rate1":"Â—82% of offers went to this group","program1":"Urban Planning and Design","code1":"K52A","interest1":"Humanities & Interdisciplinary","method1":"Limited Unscreened","seats9ge1":"94","grade9gefilledflag1":"N","grade9geapplicants1":"142","seats9swd1":"19","grade9swdfilledflag1":"N","grade9swdapplicants1":"51","seats101":"Yes-10","admissionspriority11":"Priority to Brooklyn students or residents who attend an information session","admissionspriority21":"Then to New York City residents who attend an information session","admissionspriority31":"Then to Brooklyn students or residents","admissionspriority41":"Then to New York City residents","grade9geapplicantsperseat1":"2","grade9swdapplicantsperseat1":"3","primary_address_line_1":"400 Irving Avenue","city":"Brooklyn","zip":"11237","state_code":"NY","latitude":"40.69646","longitude":"-73.9118","community_board":"4","council_district":"37","census_tract":"435","bin":"3076908","bbl":"3033650098","nta":"Bushwick North                                                             ","borough":"BROOKLYN "}
